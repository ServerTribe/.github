## IT Environment Integration Management

IT Environment Integration Management is the discipline whereby all of the 
deploying, scaling, migrating, and managing of infrastructure, systems, and 
processes are streamlined and captured. These processes may include 
implementing, upgrading, scheduling, automating repetitive tasks, backups, 
data restoration, and disaster recovery.

## SysOps and Attune

SysOps is like being a superhero for computers and technology. They make 
sure that all the computer systems and networks in a company work well and 
are safe. They fix any problems that come up, and make sure that everything 
is running smoothly. They also help with making new computer programs and 
updates to make sure that the technology is always improving. Think of them 
as the ones who keep the technology in a company healthy and running like a 
well-oiled machine.

SysOps have to do a lot of boring and repetitive tasks on their computer 
systems and networks, and it consumes a lot of their time. This means they 
can't do other important things and might not finish their work on time. But, 
there's a special SysOps helper called Attune that can perform those 
repetitive tasks automatically. It makes everything go faster and helps 
SysOps be more efficient.
