# ServerTribe's Attune IT Automation and Orchestration

Tedious repetitive tasks are bogging down System Administrator’s and wasting 
precious time. Tasks are missing deadlines and they are not as efficient as 
you know they can be.

Our software solution Attune automates and orchestrates processes to streamline 
deployments, scaling, migrations, and management of your systems. We’re using 
the Attune platform to build a community of sharable automated and orchestrated 
processes.

System Administrator’s can leverage the publicly available orchestrated 
blueprints to increase their productivity, and accelerate the delivery of 
projects. System Administrator’s can open-source their own and improve existing 
community orchestrated projects.

This account contains *Attune Projects* that contain IT automated and orchestrated 
processes. Attune is your simple and flexible IT Automation and 
Orchestration solution, that can be configured to perform any process or 
task that a System Administrator or Database Administrator would perform 
through a terminal.

The *Attune Community Edition* can be 
[downloaded for free](https://www.servertribe.com/comunity-edition/) 
from our [ServerTribe website](https://www.servertribe.com/). You can learn 
more about Attune through 
[ServerTribe's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLRvZajNQXfQPJnYFdeXZ3w).

The collective power of a community of talented individuals working in concert 
delivers not only more ideas, but quicker development and troubleshooting when 
issues arise.
