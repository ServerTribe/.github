# ServerTribe's Attune - Orchestrating processes and Capturing knowledge

Tedious repetitive tasks are bogging down System Administrator’s and wasting 
precious time. Tasks are missing deadlines and System Administrator's are 
not as efficient as you know they can be.

Our software solution 
[Attune](https://www.servertribe.com/comunity-edition/) 
automates your 
[IT Environment Integration Management](https://github.com/ServerTribe/ "IT Environment Integration Management")
. We’re building a community of sharable automated and orchestrated processes 
to be used on the Attune platform.

System Administrator’s can leverage the publicly available orchestrated 
blueprints to increase their productivity, and accelerate the delivery of 
projects. System Administrator’s can open-source their own and improve existing 
community orchestrated projects.

*The collective power of a community of talented individuals working in concert 
delivers not only more ideas, but quicker development and troubleshooting when 
issues arise.*

## IT Environment Integration Management

IT Environment Integration Management is the discipline whereby all of the 
deploying, scaling, migrating, and managing of infrastructure, systems, and 
processes are streamlined and captured. These processes may include 
implementing, upgrading, scheduling, automating repetitive tasks, backups, 
data restoration, and disaster recovery.

## SysOps and Attune

SysOps is like being a superhero for computers and technology. They make 
sure that all the computer systems and networks in a company work well and 
are safe. They fix any problems that come up, and make sure that everything 
is running smoothly. They also help with making new computer programs and 
updates to make sure that the technology is always improving. Think of them 
as the ones who keep the technology in a company healthy and running like a 
well-oiled machine.

SysOps have to do a lot of boring and repetitive tasks on their computer 
systems and networks, and it consumes a lot of their time. This means they 
can't do other important things and might not finish their work on time. But, 
there's a special SysOps helper called Attune that can perform those 
repetitive tasks automatically. It makes everything go faster and helps 
SysOps be more efficient.
